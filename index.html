            I go by Chris, Zichko, or Z. If you play Old School Runescape or many other games with me you probably know me by TheZichko. 
            I have that as my gamertag because I am more than likely the only Zichko you will ever meet.

            I am a USMC veteran. I have been raised and taught my whole life that I need to be doing hard labor to be able to make a living. That is fine if it is your thing.
             However, one of my all time favorite games is Soduku, so I enjoy being intellectually challenged and imagining how everything will play out if I put the 9 in the bottom left corner. 
             That being said I started out in Python learning literally by myself with FreeCodeCamp, Python for Dummies, Google, and YouTube. It has shown me that there is a job field that satisfies my 
             passion for the intellectual challenge, and I love that and how grindy coding can be.
