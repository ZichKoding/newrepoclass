# HTML Activity

This is where I made a basic HTML page and using Git Bash to help me pull, push, and commit to GitHub. The first activity was making the directory, changing directories, and creating files with the terminal. Then we created the repository in GitHub and used the terminal to clone the repository, and used the terminal to create a README.md file. We then checked the status, commit, and pushed to the repository we made here in GitHub.
